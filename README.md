# IT WORKSHOP-PYTHON-CODES
Here are some Python programs that I did for the IT Workshop assignments of the 3rd semester in the 2nd year curriculum of BTech CSE.

## How to Install

1. Create a ```Python``` virtual environment. 
2. Clone the repo : ```git clone https://github.com/AbhishiktaRay03/PCC-CS393-PYTHON-IT-WORKSHOP.git``` or download the repository.
3. Go to the cloned/downloaded directory ``` cd <folder_name> ```.  
4. Go to the Python website.
5. Download the software.
6. Install it according to the guide.
7. Open terminal and type python --version to see whether it is properly installed or not.
8. And now you can run the example scripts or create your own scripts. 

## Usage
- To run any python program, run  ```python filename.py```, where filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.
If the above command doesn't work, then run ``` python3 filename.py```, where again filename is the name of the file you are wanting to execute.

## FAQ
- How to stop the script? Ctrl+C (control+C for Mac) 
- For any other problems, feel free to raise an issue.
